    'Generally, a strong defense is critical; never leave an open-2-in-a-row or any 3-in-a-row alone. Strive to deny your opponent any opportunity to build up. A wise person once said, "Don\'t lose". You cannot win if you lose.',
    "Playing pieces (in priority order, i.e. timing is everything!)",
    "Placing first in a swap variant: do not place the black pieces within 7 spaces of each other unless they are closer than 3 spaces to the edge.",
    "To swap or not: if you have the choice, then take black unless the black pieces are more than 7 spaces apart or they are closer than 3 spaces to the edge.",
    "The most powerful way to win is to set up two winning lines at the same time (also called a fork).",
    "Open Four - Four in a row with both ends open. You win next turn unless blocked.",
    "Open Three - Three in a row with both ends open, which can easily become an Open Four.",
    "The center gives you the maximum branching possibilities for attack and defense.",
    "Don't just react to what your opponent do - play moves that require them to block.",
    "If you put all your stones into extending a single row, a good opponent will block it, and youâ€™ll have wasted several moves.",
